# 3D-connect-four
A self-maded 3D conect-four in python. The idea came from my school mate.\n\n

run <main.py> to start the game\n
use mouse to play the game\n
key "x" or "y" or "z" combine arrow key <RIGHT> and <LEFT> to view different columm of the board\n
this can change the viewing and it helps player to judge the game more conveniently\n
