# 3D-connect-four
A self-maded 3D conect-four in python. The idea came from my school mate.

Run <main.py> to start the game.  
Use mouse to play the game.  
Key "x" or "y" or "z" combine arrow key <RIGHT> and <LEFT> to view different columm of the board.  
This can change the viewing and it helps player to judge the game more conveniently.
